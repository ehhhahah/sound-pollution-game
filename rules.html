        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Sound Pollution Game is designed to test your ability to identify different types of sound pollution in
          your environment. The game consists of two main phases: listening and guessing.
        </p>

      <div class="rules-section">
        <h2>Game Phases</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1: Listening (30 seconds)</h3>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>Multiple sound pollution samples will play simultaneously</li>
          <li>Sounds will play in a loop during this phase</li>
          <li>Pay attention to identify as many different sounds as possible</li>
          <li>You can adjust your listening time using the time adjustment buttons</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: Guessing (10 seconds)</h3>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>Sounds will stop playing</li>
          <li>You must identify the sounds you heard from the available options</li>
          <li>Click on the sounds you believe were playing</li>
          <li>Click "Apply Guess" when you're done or wait for the timer to end</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rules-section">
        <h2>Scoring System</h2>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>Points are awarded based on the amplitude (loudness) of correctly identified sounds</li>
          <li>Quieter sounds are worth more points (up to 100 points)</li>
          <li>Very loud sounds have a minimum point value of 10 points</li>
          <li>Incorrect guesses result in a 20-point penalty</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="rules-important">
          <h3>Time Adjustment Scoring</h3>
          <ul class="rules-list">
            <li>Decreasing time by 10 seconds: +50 points bonus</li>
            <li>Increasing time by 10 seconds: -25 points penalty</li>
            <li>Time cannot be reduced below 10 seconds</li>
            <li>Time cannot be increased above 60 seconds</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h2>Game Controls</h2>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li><strong>Start Game:</strong> Begins a new game session</li>
          <li><strong>Time Adjustment Buttons:</strong> Available during the listening phase</li>
          <li><strong>Sound Buttons:</strong> Click to identify sounds during the guessing phase</li>
          <li><strong>Apply Guess:</strong> Submit your sound identifications</li>
          <li><strong>Play Again:</strong> Start a new game after completion</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rules-section">
        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
        <ul class="rules-list">
          <li>Focus on identifying quieter sounds first as they're worth more points</li>
          <li>Be careful with your guesses - wrong answers cost points</li>
          <li>Consider the time adjustment trade-off: less time means more points, but less time to listen</li>
          <li>Remember that sounds can overlap, so listen carefully for multiple sources</li>
        </ul>
